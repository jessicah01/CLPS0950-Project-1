Connect 4: MATLAB Edition is a collaborative project for Brown University course CLPS 0950. The primary contributors are Isaac Kim, Jenny Wang, and Jessica Hong.

## Playing the Game

This project's main version is written in Matlab App Designer, and can be run by opening the `homescreen.mlapp` file and clicking "Run" on top.  
As a backup, a text-based version of the game can be played by executing the code in `game.m`.
